# Coffee-machine
 It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, I worked on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. We can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money. This project allows me to  practice working with functions, challenge myself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python.
